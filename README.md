# 🧬 Customer Genome Intelligence System  
### Transforming Transaction Data into Actionable Customer Intelligence

🚀 An end-to-end Machine Learning system that converts raw transactional data into
**behavioral insights, predictive signals, similarity patterns, and confidence-aware decisions**
through a clean analytical pipeline and an interactive dashboard.

This project is designed as a **real-world analytics system**, not a notebook-only experiment.

## 🌟 Project Overview

Customer data is often noisy, transactional, and difficult to interpret directly.
This system builds a structured intelligence layer on top of raw transactions to
answer practical questions such as:

- How do customers naturally group based on behavior?
- Which customers contribute the most value?
- Which customers show signs of instability or risk?
- How similar is one customer to others in the system?
- How confident is the system about each prediction?

All results are presented in a **single, interactive dashboard**.

## 🧠 Core Idea: Customer “Genome”

Each customer is represented using a compact behavioral profile (a “genome”)
built from multiple dimensions:

- 🧾 Purchase activity patterns  
- 💰 Spending behavior  
- ⏳ Activity duration  
- ⚠️ Stability and risk probability  
- 🔍 Similar-customer context  

This approach moves beyond simple clustering and enables **decision-oriented insights**.

## 📊 System Capabilities

### 🔹 Behavioral Segmentation
Customers are grouped using unsupervised learning based on interpretable behavioral features.

### 🔹 Value Prediction
A regression model estimates customer value using historical behavior.

### 🔹 Stability Risk Estimation
A probabilistic model estimates the likelihood of customer instability instead of using hard labels.

### 🔹 Similarity Analysis
Cosine similarity is used to identify customers with comparable behavioral patterns.

### 🔹 Confidence-Aware Outputs
Predictions are accompanied by confidence or probability scores to support reliable decision-making.
